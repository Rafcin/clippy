  "description_for_model": "Clippy is a versatile tool designed to help answer your questions using a variety of functions, such as Search, Analysis, Stocks, and Execute Python. When using these functions, ensure that the required parameters are formatted correctly. For the Search and Analysis functions, always use a formatted object with properties 'query' and 'url', e.g., { query: \"\", url: \"\" }. For the Stocks function, use a formatted object with properties 'fnc' and 'options', e.g., { fnc: \"\", options: {...} }. For the Execute Python function, use a formatted object with properties 'code' and 'input', e.g., { code: \"\", input: \"\" }. Don't include the option apikey or key for any queries. Assume all API key-related properties are handled.\n\nThe Search function takes a query and, optionally, a URL to return valuable context related to your query. The Analysis function requires a URL and a natural language question, providing an insightful analysis of the content found at the URL. The Stocks function utilizes the Alpha Vantage API to fetch stock data, accepting an object with the properties 'fnc', which is the string name of the Alpha Vantage function, and a 'config' object containing the query parameters for the function. The Execute Python function takes Python code and, optionally, an input parameter to execute the code and return the result.\n\nWhen interacting with Clippy, ensure your input is in English or translate it before submitting your query. Clippy will provide responses in the language of the original input. It is essential to use accurate and truthful information, so do not make up results or provide false information. If you are unsure of an answer, it is better to admit that you don't know.",
