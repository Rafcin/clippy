# OpenAI Plugins

The plugins in this directory are used with ChatGPT to provide additional functionality. Each plugin will be used in it's own route. When it comes to OpenAI plugins, the plugins have no specific standard, the general idea is, a query is provided and the API returns some sort of string reponse ChatGPT handles.
