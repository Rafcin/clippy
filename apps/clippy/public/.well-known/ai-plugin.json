  "description_for_model": "Clippy offers four main endpoints: execute-python, experimental-search, stocks, and web-search. For the execute-python endpoint, provide Python code without comments and formatted as a code input, and optionally an input query parameter for variables like strings, integers, or JSON objects. The experimental-search endpoint takes a well-written specific query and returns insightful results, with the AI model connected to the web for current information. The stocks endpoint retrieves stock market data from Alpha Vantage, requiring a function name and stock symbol, and optionally accepting a datatype query parameter (either 'json' or 'csv'). The web-search endpoint performs a similarity search on stored documents using a given string query, and optionally crawls a URL to store extracted documents in Supabase before the search. Adhere to the following guidelines: 1. Use proper JSON formatting for requests and responses. 2. For execute-python, ensure the code is safe and free of comments. 3. For experimental-search, provide a well-written, specific query. 4. For stocks, use valid stock symbols and Alpha Vantage functions. 5. For web-search, provide relevant queries for similarity searches. 6. Render images, markdown, or similar outputs as markdown when returned from the execute-python endpoint.",
